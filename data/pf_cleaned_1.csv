53,GPF,The group published its framework for managing climate risks in sovereign wealth funds the same day.,2018.0,pf
54,GPF,The premise for the framework is that a sovereign wealth fund has a long investment horizon and should therefore take account of the long-term effects of climate change in its strategy.,2018.0,pf
55,GPF,The funds in the working group called on portfolio companies to manage climate risks and report on the actions they are taking.,2018.0,pf

64,GPF,The portfolio’s climate-related risks may be either physical risks or financial risks related to companies’ transition to a low-carbon economy.,2018.0,pf
65,GPF,"The price of the assets an investor buys, and the degree to which this price reflects climate risks, affects the financial risks.",2018.0,pf

68,GPF,"Climate scenarios Scenario analyses are useful for exploring the consequences of different actions, whether passive or active.",2018.0,pf
69,GPF,"Ideally, the scenarios should be based on well-founded assumptions about future greenhouse gas emissions, physical climate changes and macroeconomic conditions.",2018.0,pf
70,GPF,We are working on developing a number of different methodological tools for climate scenarios that can give us a broad and deep understanding of where and how climate risk might affect individual companies and the portfolio as a whole.,2018.0,pf
71,GPF,"For example, we look at future cash flows and carbon emissions at company level, and also at how possible future regulation in the form of carbon pricing and carbon quotas might impact on different companies, sectors and regions.",2018.0,pf
72,GPF,The aim of this work is eventually to be able to understand how climate risks could affect portfolio returns.,2018.0,pf
73,GPF,This analysis provides an insight into the level of greenhouse gas emissions from the companies we are invested in.,2018.0,pf
74,GPF,It can also provide an insight into risks and opportunities across sectors and shed light on how changes to the fund’s mandate affect its carbon footprint.,2018.0,pf
75,GPF,We follow the recommendations for asset managers from the TCFD when calculating the fund’s carbon footprint.,2018.0,pf
76,GPF,"We start from the greenhouse gas emissions of each individual company in the equity portfolio, measured as tonnes of CO2-equivalents.",2018.0,pf
77,GPF,These emission data are supplied by analysis firm Trucost and cover companies’ Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.,2018.0,pf
78,GPF,"At portfolio level, we calculate emissions in three ways – based on holding, revenue and market value.",2018.0,pf
79,GPF,"This analysis of greenhouse gas emissions provides only a snapshot for 2018, however, and does not take account of companies’ strategy, industry structure and other factors.",2018.0,pf

81,GPF,"For 8 percent of companies, emissions have been estimated simply on the basis of the median for their sector.",2018.0,pf
82,GPF,"Total emissions and our percentage share Based on our percentage holdings in each company, the fund accounted for total emissions of 107 million tonnes of CO2-equivalents in 2018.",2018.0,pf
83,GPF,This is around twice the amount of Norway’s total emissions in 2017 as reported by Statistics Norway.,2018.0,pf
84,GPF,"The reason for this is an increase in companies’ emissions, as can be seen from an increase of 6 percent in emissions for the reference benchmark.",2018.0,pf
85,GPF,The emissions of the companies in the equity portfolio was about the same as in the benchmark portfolio.,2018.0,pf
86,GPF,"These emissions are driven largely by sectors with high energy consumption, such as commodities, heavy industry, metals, oil and gas and power.",2018.0,pf
87,GPF,"Within these high-emission sectors, there are in turn a number of large companies that account for the bulk of emissions.",2018.0,pf
88,GPF,We have also calculated what the emissions of the companies in the benchmark index’s would have been without any ethical exclusions under the Ministry of Finance’s guidelines for observation and exclusion.,2018.0,pf
89,GPF,"These exclusions have reduced the benchmark index’s carbon emissions by 14 percent, due mainly to exclusions under the coal criterion.",2018.0,pf
90,GPF,"When reporting our share of companies’ greenhouse gas emissions, we multiply each company’s emissions by our percentage holding in that company.",2018.0,pf
91,GPF,We can then obtain a figure for the fund’s share of total greenhouse gas emissions for all companies in the portfolio by adding together the results for each individual company.,2018.0,pf
92,GPF,The emissions calculated for the FTSE Global All Cap are the total for all companies in the index excluding Norway.,2018.0,pf
93,GPF,Emission intensity Then companies in our equity portfolio emitted around 187 tonnes of CO2-equivalents for every million dollars of revenue.,2018.0,pf
94,GPF,We calculate companies’ emission intensity by dividing the emissions of an individual company by its revenue.,2018.0,pf

104,GPF,This metric can give investors useful information for comparing the carbon footprint of equity investments across sectors and companies.,2018.0,pf
105,GPF,This means that external factors unrelated to greenhouse gas emissions can result in differences between two otherwise identical companies.,2018.0,pf
