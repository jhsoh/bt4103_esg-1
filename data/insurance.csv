4073,AXA,"As highlighted in this report’s introduction and climate scenario section, the Paris Agreement’s goal to contain global warming below 2°C invites all market participants to reorient “finance flows” in line with this target.",2021.0
4074,AXA,The TCFD guidelines expect “asset owners to describe how they consider the positioning of their total portfolio with respect to the transition to a lower-carbon economy”.,2021.0
4075,AXA,"More generally, many stakeholders are expecting the finance industry’s contribution to the climate debate to embrace the concept of “Paris-aligned investments”.",2021.0
4076,AXA,"The answers so far have taken various shapes, also explored in this report, such as carbon footprinting (which is not forward-looking), divestments (which only focus on the most carbon-intensive sectors), green investments (which are challenging to bring to scale and often overlook “transition” sectors) or shareholder engagement (with results that are sometimes difficult to measure).",2021.0
4077,AXA,"Since 2018, AXA has leveraged a “transition risk” model developed with Swiss environmental fintech Carbon Delta (recently acquired by MSCI) which produces the “Warming Potential” (WP) metric expressed in terms of temperature.",2021.0
4078,AXA,Its modeling approach combines top-down data and bottom-up economic and company data to establish a forward-looking climate-related set of metrics.,2021.0
4079,AXA,Indeed the “Warming Potential” methodology relies on a top down approach based on:❯ co u n t r y - l e v e l “ Pa r i s A g re e m e n t ” commitments projecting carbon intensities to 2030 (the horizon of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs (1)) presented to the COP21); ❯ gaps between NDCs and carbon emissions budget associated to various temperature scenarios (according to the UNEP Gap report); ❯ company-level business mix structures by sectors and countries; ❯ company-level current carbon intensities and R&D in green technologies/products; ❯ R&D in green technologies/products highlighting “transition” opportunities.,2021.0
4080,AXA,One of the key features of Carbon Delta MSCI’s approach is to correlate macro level “carbon budgets” (describing carbon emissions and sinks at the global level) with companies (as individual carbon emitters) depending on their geographic footprint and sector as well as business mix.,2021.0
4081,AXA,This “temperature” concept provides a measure of the gap between future carbon pledges and science-based emissions budget still available before global warming increases.,2021.0
4082,AXA,"By working with Carbon Delta MSCI, AXA developed a more balanced “Warming Potential” approach considering both companies’ absolute and sector-relative co n t r i b u t i o n s to g l o ba l wa r m i n g .",2021.0
4083,AXA,"This combines a so-called “sector-specific” approach (which takes into account regulatory perspectives of a given country on its economic sector), and a “sector-agnostic” approach (which is based on an absolute emissions intensity view, regardless of sectors or the functioning of an economy).",2021.0
4084,AXA,"The figures disclosed in this report combine and average both approaches to retain an emphasis on emissions reductions from carbon-intensive sectors (this reflects the “sector-specific” bias), while still ensuring that all other sectors are expected to contribute to the transition to a low-carbon economy (“sector-agnostic” bias).",2021.0
4085,AXA,This deliberate methodological choice factors both the sectors’ relative contributions to climate mitigation as well as individual companies’ best practices within their respective industries to curb carbon emissions.,2021.0
4086,AXA,"Indeed, AXA believes that each player in the global economy should have a responsibility to support the low carbon transition, and in turn, investors who are committed to support the energy transition should have a responsibility to identify, within each sector, the companies best prepared for this transition – as described in this report.",2021.0
4087,AXA,"Strategy, Metrics & Targets While initially focused on Scope 1 emissions, Carbon Delta MSCI brought significant updates to its methodology in 2020:❯ for transition risks assessment, both self- reported and estimated emissions data are combined and considered; ❯ Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions have been added in the calculation of carbon intensities; ❯ for the assessment of “green opportunities”, future green revenues reflected by patents developments have been combined with current green revenues, thus considering current exposure of companies’ revenues to green activities – not just future revenues; ❯ the “Warming Potential” “cap” which was previously set at 6°C has been increased to 10°C to capture a broader range of behavior and impacts; ❯ carbon emissions reduction targets are now included in the temperature calculation.",2021.0
4088,AXA,"These methodology changes have a profound impact on the temperature of some sectors, notably the automotive, energy, consumer services and financial sectors, which have seen their temperature and transition risks increase.",2021.0
4089,AXA,The transition risks in the oil and gas and electric utilities sectors have also increased due to the inclusion of scope 2 and 3 emissions.,2021.0
